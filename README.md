# Diabetes Prediction Model
Data Analyst and Data Scientist-in-training doing a guided project - credit to YouTuber "Developer Ashish" (Ashish Kushwaha) - involving analyzing a healthcare/medical dataset containing key health metrics like blood pressure to unearth patterns, create insightful visualizations, statistically examine the findings, and create machine-learning models.

Two main Machine Learning models were used for predicting, and evaluated at the end: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier. A further two were used for Classification: K-Means Clustering and K-Nearest Neighbors.
