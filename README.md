# Data Science Project: Diabetes Prediction
Data Analyst and Data Scientist-in-training doing a guided project - credit to YouTuber "Developer Ashish" (Ashish Kushwaha) - involving analyzing a medical/healthcare dataset with measurements of health-related metrics such as blood pressure in order to predict if a person will acquire diabetes or not.

Two main Machine Learning models were built and evaluated; two further ones were built to Classify the dataset's points optimally.
